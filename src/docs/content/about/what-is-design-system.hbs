<h2>Benefits</h2>
<h3>Build faster and at scale</h3>
<p>Save time and money with an ecosystem that is made to work together. The design system features a library of styles, components and templates, and well as advice and guidance for how and when to use each one. All contained in ready to go UI and code kits, say goodbye to building from scratch.</p>
<h3>Out-of-the-box brand and accessibility compliance</h3>
<p>Understand, apply and meet brand requirements, with features required for brand compliance indicated with a ðŸ”¹  blue diamond. Supporting the NSW Government brand framework, the design system can be used by, and bring value to any brand classification. All components and styles are also built and tested to AA 2.1 WCAG standards.</p>
<h3>Consistent code and design language</h3>
<p>When using the foundations, components and theme together, teams get access to a complete end-to-end kit for both designers and developers. The pre-built UI and code kits mean designers and developers use the same atomic components, with extended guidance also bridging the gap to help avoid design drift.</p>
<h3>Build consistent experiences with full stack quality </h3>
<p>The design system provides full-stack foundations and base components which are engineered for a good user experience. They go beyond the look-and-feel to include branding, UI styling, UX and content guidance, and front-end components. </p>
