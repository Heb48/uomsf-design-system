<p>The NSW Design System can be used by any department and brand classification, to provide a consistent approach to UI and UX for designers and developers. Even if you're not using the component kits, the design system ecosystem allows teams to identify and use only what they require.</p>

<p>While the out-of-the-box branding reflects masterbrand corporate, the in-built theming framework can be adapted for all masterbrand, co-brand and even independent classification levels. Endorsed and standalone brand classifications can also take advantage of the pre-built base, to adapt to their own brand identity.</p>
