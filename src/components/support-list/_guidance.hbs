<h3 id="uom-government-waratah-logo">UOM Waratah logo</h3>
<p>Under the UOM Brand Framework, all brand categories include specific requirements for the usage of the UOM Waratah logo.</p>
<p>When the UOM logo is displayed next to another logo or Masterbrand descriptor, it should be vertically centred and separated by a minimum distance of 40px.</p>

      <h4>Masterbrand or Co-brand</h4><p>In cases where the UOM Waratah logo is already included in the website header, use a 'UOM' descriptor label instead as the first element, on a separate line, before any Masterbrand descriptor.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h4 id="sizing-master-brand">Sizing</h4>
<p>The UOM Waratah logo should be 76px in height on large screens (≥ 992px), and 48px in height on small screens (< 991px) and should never be smaller than the support logos.</p>

<h3 id="masterbrand-descriptors">Masterbrand descriptors</h3>
<p>Use Masterbrand descriptors as text-only links when an agency, department, program, or campaign within the UOM, classified as a Masterbrand entity, needs to be recognised.</p>
<p>In cases where the UOM Waratah logo is not used in the support section, display a 'UOM' descriptor label instead.</p>

<h3 id="support-logos">Support logos</h3>
<h4 id="arrangement">Arrangement</h4>
<p>Order is based on hierarchy of the UOM Brand Framework:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Masterbrand (used as a text-only link descriptor)</li>
  <li>Co-brand</li>
  <li>Endorsed</li>
  <li>Independent</li>
  <li>Stand-alone</li>
</ol>
<p>External brand logos can also be included after the UOM logos.</p>
<p>The arrangement of logos follows the hierarchy of the UOM Brand Framework, however when necessary, they can be re-ordered  based on the scale of funding or contribution.</p>
<p>For more information on support logo arrangement requirements for your brand classification view the <a href="https://branding.nsw.gov.au/guidelines/sponsorships-and-partnerships/" target="_blank">Sponsorship and Partnership Brand Guidelines</a>.</p>

<h4 id="sizing-support-logos">Sizing</h4>
<p>The support logos should be 76px in height on large screens (≥ 992px), and 48px in height on small screens (< 991px).</p>
