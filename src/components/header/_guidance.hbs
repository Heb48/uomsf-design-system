<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The header sits under the masthead on all NSW Government websites, products and services.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the header:</p>

<h4>Masterbrand</h4>
<p>The masterbrand header contains the NSW Government logo and site descriptor (site name), with optional secondary descriptor and search.</p>

<h4>Co-brand</h4>
<p>The co-brand header contains the NSW Government logo and co-branded logo (max 76px in height), with optional search. Depending on your logoâ€™s ratio, the appropriate co-brand header should be chosen:</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal stacked:</strong> On mobile the NSW Government and co-brand logo will appear side by side. Consider this option when the co-branded logo <strong>does not exceed</strong> 130px in width when at 48px in height. If it does, always test to ensure it does not overlap search and menu functions on smaller devices.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical stacked:</strong> On mobile the NSW Government will appear on top of the co-brand logo. Consider this option when the co-branded logo <strong>does exceed</strong> 130px in width when at 48px in height. </p>

<h3>NSW Government Logo</h3>
<p>The NSW Government logo reinforces the connection to NSW Government and should always appear in the top left to create a consistent experience across digital product or services. It should appear no smaller than 76px and never smaller than the co-branded logo.</p>

<h3 id="descriptors">Descriptors</h3>
<p><strong>Descriptor:</strong> Where it is important for a customer to identify a department or agency within NSW Government, a descriptor can be used. The text descriptor is treated, not as a competing logo (or coupled), but as a navigational device to help customers where they need to identify an entity.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Descriptor:</strong> In the rare case where there is a customer need to relay back to the overarching department, two descriptors can be coupled together. Usage for this requires approval from the <a href="https://www.nsw.gov.au/branding" target="_blank">NSW Government Brand Team</a>. The secondary descriptor is located directly under the primary descriptor in smaller font.</p>

<h3>Search</h3>
<p>The search displays on the right hand side and can be omitted if not required.</p>
