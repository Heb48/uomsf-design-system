## What
> Give a brief description of the style, component or pattern you want to propose.

## Why
> Explain why you think this should be added to the NSW design system.
>
> - What evidence do you have that it's needed by multiple services across government?
> - What evidence do you have that it meets the needs of the users of those services?

## Anything else
> Include links to any examples, research or code to support your proposal, if available.
